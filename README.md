Cheat Table for F1 Manager 2022

It seems that the game is storing everything in the [in-memory SQLite3 database](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html), this cheat table allows you to export it and later import it back to the game with your editions.

The editing itself can be done with the [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
I've created an example showing how to change the team balance that you can find [here](https://github.com/xAranaktu/F1-Manager-2022-Cheat-Table/blob/main/tutorials/change_team_balance.md) and video for it you can find [here](https://streamable.com/pubd8l)

I know that it may be an unusual approach for cheat table, but I think it's extremely powerful in terms what you can edit and whatnot (I believe majority of the game content should be editable with this method).

If you find something that isn't editable through the database let me know and I'll try to create separate script for it.

I hope you enjoy it and you will play the game however you want. :)
